# MI_Style_Multitask_Prototype
An prototype simply explained how to make Xiaomi Style Multitask Interaction.

**THIS IS NOT A LIBRARY,ONLY A DEMO,The Best Resolution to Preview in Emulator is 1080 x 2340 & xxhdpi**

**THE WAY I WROTE LAYOUT IS SUCH A BAD EXAMPLE,I THINK THE ANIMATION & GESTURE PART MAYBE USEFUL FOR SOMEONE'S PROJECT**

- Multi gesture interaction
- Use rebound engine for driving complex interaction & animation
- Use Renderscript for simple blur effect.
